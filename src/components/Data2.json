As a control, pipette 0.1 mL of a 1:1000 dilution of an 18 h to 24 h culture of Staphylococcus  10 into Staphylococcus medium and proceed as with the test suspension. \n\nFor Enterobacteriaceae- Aseptically add 10 mL of the test suspension to a bottle that contains neutral red-bile salt peptone glucose medium. Incubate the bottle for 24 h to 36 h at 37 ± 0.5°C and examine for the presence of Enterobacteriaceaeas evidenced by the formation of acid and gas. \n\nFor Pseudomonas aeruginosa- Aseptically pipette 10 mL of the test suspension into 90 mL of fluid soybean-casein digests medium and mix well. Incubate for 24 h at 30 °C to 35 °C. By means of an inoculating loop transfer a portion from the 24 h incubated sample tube of fluid soybean-casein digest medium to the dry surface of petri dishes each containing approximately 20 mL of Cetrimide agar medium.

    "microbiologicalRequirementTesting": "ISO 7218\n\nFor total aerobic bacterial count- Into each of three sterile petri dishes aseptically pipette a 1 mL portion of the test suspension. To each dish add 15 mL of freshly melted plate count agar that has been cooled to 45 °C, and mix well. Incubate, count and calculate the total count as described in US ISO 4833 Part 2. From the total viable bacterial count and the mass of the sanitary towel, calculate the total viable bacterial count per gram of sanitary towel.\n\nFor Staphylococcus aureus- Use the media, reagents and procedure described in US ISO 6888-2 to examine the test suspension. As a control, pipette 0.1 mL of a 1:1000 dilution of an 18 h to 24 h culture of Staphylococcus  10 into Staphylococcus medium and proceed as with the test suspension. \n\nFor Enterobacteriaceae- Aseptically add 10 mL of the test suspension to a bottle that contains neutral red-bile salt peptone glucose medium. Incubate the bottle for 24 h to 36 h at 37 ± 0.5°C and examine for the presence of Enterobacteriaceaeas evidenced by the formation of acid and gas. \n\nFor Pseudomonas aeruginosa- Aseptically pipette 10 mL of the test suspension into 90 mL of fluid soybean-casein digests medium and mix well. Incubate for 24 h at 30 °C to 35 °C. By means of an inoculating loop transfer a portion from the 24 h incubated sample tube of fluid soybean-casein digest medium to the dry surface of petri dishes each containing approximately 20 mL of Cetrimide agar medium. Incubate at 30 °C to 35 °C and examine after 24h, and again after 48 h incubation, for suspect colonies, bearing in mind that in general greenish fluorescent colonies are typical of Pseudomonas aureginosa and that in its presence a gram stain examined microscopically will reveal gram-negative slender rod-shaped cells. \n",
